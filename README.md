Design and develop a parking inventory management system that efficiently manages the parking spaces in a designated area. It is scalable, secure, and robust enough to handle high volumes of traffic and transactions.

Technology :
Frontend: 
HTML CSS JavaScript

Backend:
Spring Boot Spring Security MVC Data JPA Thymeleaf

Key Features: 

Parking lot management: The system allows parking lot owners to manage their parking facilities efficiently, monitor occupancy, and generate reports. Real-time parking information: The system provides real-time information to drivers about the availability of parking spaces in the parking facility.

Parking reservation: The system allows drivers to reserve parking spots in advance, ensuring that they have a spot reserved for them when they arrive at the parking lot.

Payment gateway integration: The system integrates with various payment gateways to allow drivers to pay for parking online, eliminating the need for cash payments.

Automated parking management: The system automates parking management tasks, such as monitoring parking occupancy, and generating reports.

Benefits: 
1)Efficient parking management
 2)Improved customer experience 
3)Reduced traffic congestion

Conclusion: 
A parking inventory management system is an important tool for managing parking spaces efficiently. It can help reduce traffic congestion, increase revenue, and improve customer satisfaction. 
The system can also provide valuable data on parking patterns and trends, which can be used to optimize parking lot layouts and inform future planning decisions. In addition, it can help reduce the environmental impact of parking by reducing the number of vehicles circling for a space and improving traffic flow.Project Description: Design and develop a parking inventory management system that efficiently manages the parking spaces in a designated area.
